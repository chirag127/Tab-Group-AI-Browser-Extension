## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Tab Management

- Close all tabs in a group when you're done with a task by collapsing the group and clicking each X.

### Customization

- Rename groups to match your specific projects or tasks.
- Move tabs between groups to create a custom organization system.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## Troubleshooting

### Tabs Not Categorizing Correctly

If tabs aren't being categorized as expected:

1. Check your internet connection.
2. Ensure the backend server is running.
3. Click the refresh button to try again.
4. If problems persist, try the manual organization by dragging tabs between groups.

### UI Issues

If the UI appears broken or unresponsive:

1. Close and reopen the extension popup.
