# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, please report it to us immediately.

**Do not report vulnerabilities publicly** until we have had a chance to address them.

Please send your report to [Your Contact Email or Security Team Contact] with as much detail as possible. This should include:

*   The specific version of the project where the vulnerability exists.
*   A description of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Any potential impact of the vulnerability.

We aim to respond to security reports within [Number] business days. We will work with you to understand the vulnerability, verify it, and develop a fix.

## Supported Versions

Use our project's latest version.

## Security Best Practices

We strive to follow security best practices. Here are some of the measures we take:

*   **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** We adhere to secure coding guidelines to avoid common vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** We regularly update our dependencies to address known vulnerabilities and use tools to scan for vulnerabilities in our dependencies (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot).
*   **Encryption:** Sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
*   **Access Control:** We implement appropriate access controls to restrict access to sensitive resources.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** We may conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Secrets Management:** API keys and other secrets are securely managed and not stored directly in the code.

## Security Response Team

The security of this project is maintained by [Your Security Team or Individual Names and/or Contact Information].

## Disclosure Policy

Once a fix is available, we will:

*   Publicly disclose the vulnerability and the fix.
*   Credit the reporter (if they wish) in the disclosure.

We will aim to provide a reasonable timeframe for users to update their installations before publicly disclosing a vulnerability.
